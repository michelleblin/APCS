(a)

public static boolean runSimulation(int sampleSize)
{
  int half1 = 0;
  int half2 = 0;
  for(int i=0; i<sampleSize; i++)
  {
    int n = getInt();
    if(n.isTarget() && n>0)
    {
      if(i<sampleSize/2)
        half1++;
      else
        half2++;
    }
  }
  return half1>half2;
}


(b)
in the TargerIntegerClass you will need a new private static final int sampleSize assigned to the number of times you want to be analyzed.
the runSimulation method would no longer need a parameter and would use the class variable SampleSize
