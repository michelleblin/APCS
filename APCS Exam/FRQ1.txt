}



(c)
public double getCompoundAmountUsed(String compound)
in the Trial class their needs to be a new method public double getAmount() which returns the amount of substance used in a trial.
The Trial class constructor may need a new parameter and the Trial class may need a new private double instance variable amount.
In the getCompoundAmountUsed method you would need a int total to keep track of substance used so far.
Then loop through trialList to find instances of the compound and add the amount used with getAmount to the total. finally return total.
